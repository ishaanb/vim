# vim
Making my vim universal!

Putting out my vim config to easily apply to a remote machine.

CAREFUL!
If you are not a vim user and are using this as a start. If you are already a vim user then just look at my vimrc file to pick what you like:
git clone https://github.com/ishaanb/vim.git ~/.
mv ~/vim ~/.vim
cp ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
